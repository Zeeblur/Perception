big
pick up pillar 


Write a guide for it


Get used to the room.
Look for a red cube on the floor
From there give the red cube to one of the matter mutts.

--------------------------


Surreal.
Spatailsation of the sound very good. Turning head - felt like the dogs were behind you. etc
Felt like grew
shrinking was more realistic 
felt presence reach out and touch
knock over good. 
I felt like I changed - perspectives changed. GOOD. didn't feel like room moved. 
ducked when big

looked straight up when small

didn't feel like i moved when i transitioned.


----

felt more real than thought it would
sound is effective - localisation everythings where it should sound
graphics good - big boys a bit weird
felt same as a game - way things changed. 
transistions are strange - felt almost too fast. 
floors textures better
improvement dogs fall over 
- gave impression that they were holograms the dogs

moving around and interactivity was good.
MORE GAMEPLAY


-------------------


no XP with VR so very unsure about movement, that they could walk around look around bend over etc.

different perspective rather that I changed, didn't feel like the room had changed just the way you were looking at it
maybe more realstic enviornment would help graphics caused disconnect



---------------------------

Everyone has tried to pick up the cube out of the wall.
